SevenMinutes
============

SevenMinutes is an HTML5+JavaScript (JQuery) application I built for the Tizen mobile platform during [#TizenLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TizenLA) at [#CrossCampusLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CrossCampusLA). This application times each segment of your workout, making it easier to follow the Seven-Minute-Workout.

The exercise images are currently based on an image posted in the NY Times [(here)](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/). I'll replace this as soon as I am able.

Other notes
===========

I've been using [7-min](http://7-min.com/) for the past couple months, it is fantastic!
